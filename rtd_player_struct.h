 * Bytes 8-11: (32-bit int) Packet size in bytes without stop and start string
 * Bytes 12-15: (32-bit int) Packet type (always zero for data packets)
 * Bytes 16-19: (32-bit int) Number of synchronous samples per channel
 * Bytes 20-27: (64-bit int) Number of samples acquired so far
 * Bytes 28-35: (Double floating point) Absolute/relative time
 *              (# days since 12/30/1899 | number of days since start of acq)
 * 
 * *Total header offset is 36 bytes*
 *
 * Bytes 36-39: Number of samples (for synchronous channels only)
 * Bytes 40-(# of samples * sample data type, which should be two-byte unsigned words): Data
